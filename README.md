# Final Group Project : "OCDC"
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2025

## Theme
We chose to interpret the theme as you only get one true path, and one true end. Due to the nature of the PC's amnesia and OCD, there is only one way to complete the game which is to recreate your exact schedule. And the only ending, whether it's painted in good or bad light, is that you go back to bed. 

## Game Play
Your goal is to make it all the way through one day in your life. You play the game by selecting choice options at different times that propel you through your day. Incorrect options will send you back to bed and make you restart from the beggining, but you can take note of correct choices to help you remember the path after subsequent runs.

## Impediments
Evan: While working on my section I ran into problems making my notebook work as intended but was able to solve that by looking closer through the documentation which helped me make better variables. I also ran into trouble with my files not saving correctly after I compiled all the documents, which I solved by just creating a brand new ink and combining them into that.

Isaac: I had some issues trying to decide how I wanted the notes to work around the house, however once I figured it out it was a pretty simple process from there. I shouldn't have just named things choice# and just gave everything a number which made it hard to keep track of everything.

Jason: I struggled with making choices enjoyable when there was only one correct solution. I made my section more engaging by giving the illusion of some choices being correct until you reach a point where none of the options are accurate. This made it so that choosing the wrong option wasn't just telling you to try again, but instead led you to believe you chose correctly before putting you at a dead end.

## Implementation
A standard Ink text adventure, so different story nodes.

## References
Inspired in part by a small game called Save the Date

## Future Development
Turning it into a narrative adventure with actual scenes through Unity rather than it just being text.
